Run time analysis - 

* Task0: O(1)
  * All the operations here are about accessing the array elements and one is to find the length of the array. Both the operations take O(1) as run time complexity.
* Task1: O(n)
  * There are two for loops, and the inside statments takes O(1) - for access. The loops, however takes O(n)
* Task2: O(n)
  * There's one for loop that runs through the length of the array. Inside statments have static complexity. Hence, O(n).
* Task3: O(nlogn)
  * There's one for loop that gets us the result, inside statements have static time complexity. And the loop runs through all the array elemtns. Hence, O(n).
  * The sorted() method takes O(nlogn) to compute. 
  * So, the worst time complexity - O(nlogn)
* Task4: O(nlogn)
  * Again, the loop traverses through all the array elements, hence O(n).
  * But the sorted() method takes O(nlogn) complexity.
  * So, the worst time complexity - O(nlogn)
